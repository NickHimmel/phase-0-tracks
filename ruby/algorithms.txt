In phase-0-tracks/ruby/algorithms.txt, write the algorithm for using an elevator. Remember, robots are not smart at all, so you'll have to spell everything out.
For instance, how will your robot figure out which floor button to press?

Ask which floor number from the list of floor numbers. 
Find the floor button that matches the floor number requested 
If the floor button is found:
Press the floor button.
Wait until the elevator has stopped moving and the doors have opened.
Exit the Elevator
Otherwise: 
Tell the person the floor number could not be found.
Ask the person which floor number they would like again.


Release 1: Find a Real-Life Algorithm
You're a smart human, not a dumb computer. That means you likely follow algorithms on a daily basis without even knowing it, taking your astonishing abilities completely for granted.
DO THE THING
Come up with an example of a common task in your life that could be translated into an algorithm, and write out the steps in algorithms.txt (labeled with the name of the task).
