# Prompt the designer/user for all of this information.
# Convert any user input to the appropriate data type.
# Print the hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered all of the questions.
# Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine). After all, sometimes users make mistakes! If the designer says "none", skip it. But if the designer enters "decor_theme" (for example), your program should ask for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. (Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) You can assume the user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash -- no need to handle user errors.
# Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.


#Write a method that prompts the designer/user for all the information

#Write a method that checks data types

#update key method

#declare a hash
#pass that hash to the method to get information
#print that hash
#pass that hash to the method to check data type
#pass that hash to the update key method
#print the hash
