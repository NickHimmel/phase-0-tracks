At the bottom of your individual HTML page, create a comment where you reflect on the challenge. Answer the following questions within that block comment:

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to create more semantic markup, i.e. an easy to understand layout that is well organized. You are better defining the structure of a website. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser displays the elements from the top of your html on down. It goes in order from top to bottom. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

That templates are super helpful and simple to set up. Absolutely 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

Properly using some of the semantic tags can be a little confusing. Such as how much of your content goes in a main tag. I can keep reading documentation while looking at great websites online to further my understanding of use cases.
