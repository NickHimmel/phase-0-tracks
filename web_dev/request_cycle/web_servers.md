### FIND THE THING

**1.What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?**

One of the key design philosophies of Linux is that it is open source project and a collaborative effort. This means that Linux is free! You don't have to pay for a license every time you want to use it, which makes it a great operating system to use for a VPS. 

**2.In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?**

VPS or virtual private server is a virtual computer you pay for. If you pay for hosting service your website is being hosted on a physical machine and administrators are keeping that server running. A virtual server is when you pay to have a physical server create a walled off version of a server, a block of code that mimics the larger machine, with its own computer operating system. Some advantages include the fact that you can play around with your website, operating system and or apps without worrying about damaging or destroying anything. With your own VPS you have total control and it is cheaper. My favorite description of VPS I found compares it to buying a condo. [VPS Hosting Guide](http://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/vps-hosting-guide/ ) You own it, but the a lot of the infrastructure is communal. Dedicated Hosting is like renting. The downsides to VPS are how much space you have, the size and speed of it and it requires you to be the administrator and deal with any issues that come up. 

**3.Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?**

It is a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system, because it defeats the built in security systems designed to protect you from damaging your operating system. Make mistakes, delete the wrong thing, have a bad program crash, etc. and you can irrevocably damage the core of your linux system.
