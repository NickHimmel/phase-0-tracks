#Tackling Jquery
##The plan
* Give yourself time to research
* Find a cheatsheet or two that you can always reference
* Break down the assignment into manageable chunks and test oftne
* As with Ruby build it piece by piece, break it down to smaller assignments
* When stuck research and keep at it
* If an error persists take a break though!
* Breaks are important, walk away and come back you will see something you didn't before.
* Don't get burned out
* Keep an eye on the time and make sure you are not digging yourself deeper into a hole.
